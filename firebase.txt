Install Firebase CLI
To host your site with Firebase Hosting, you need the Firebase CLI (a command line tool).

Run the following npm command to install the CLI or update to the latest CLI version.

npm install -g firebase-tools

You can deploy now or later. To deploy now, open a terminal window, then navigate to or create a root directory for your web app.

Sign in to Google
firebase login
Initiate your project
Run this command from your app’s root directory:

firebase init
When you’re ready, deploy your web app
Put your static files (e.g., HTML, CSS, JS) in your app’s deploy directory (the default is “public”). Then, run this command from your app’s root directory:

firebase deploy
After deploying, view your app at fypannotator.web.app
